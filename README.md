This project has been redesigned using React Native on https://github.com/ESJai/sales-calc-native.


It is intended for anyone who needs to calculate the total cost quickly on the products they sell in an sale event like one of those kiosk system in some restaurants where you can quickly add the items for an order.

Styling for different devices is still in progress as the app was initially designed for my friend to use it on a mobile device.
